# CircuiTikZ Tool
This project is designed to be an open-source tool for creating schematics with CircuiTikz. 
Currently this program only supports path objects (resistors, capacitors, wires, etc.) but hopefully more will come along in the future. 
The goal here isn't to create a "full eda experience" but instead to simplify creating schematics in CircuiTikz by removing the tedious part of creating paths using the coordinate system. 

## Running CircuiTikZ Tool
A lot of work still needs to be done before adding a full release to this repo.
For the time being there is a runnable pre-release .jar file included in the "releases" tab of the project repo that can be downloaded. 
This project is still young so if you find any bugs while running the program please add them to the issue tracker.
